## Project Overview

poof.sh is a simple service that allows you to create short-lived text "files" that can be shared to anyone but can only be viewed once. A disposable text file that can be used to share one-time information with someone. When a user creates an entry, they are given a short URL that can be shared with anyone, but once that entry is viewed, it is deleted from the system.

This service is 100% free and open-source. The goal for this is to be easily self-hosted (ideally one command to get it running).
